            When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber, and a terrifying
            psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most
            frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the
            U.S. government, and the entertainment industry, they must pull off
            a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which
            they can trust nobody â€” least of all each other.
            <br />

            Current players can transfer both GTAV Story Mode progress and GTA
            Online characters and progression to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series
